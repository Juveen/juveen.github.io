							Sonny 2 is the sequel to the popular flash game Sonny, and continues the storyline where Sonny left off. It, like Sonny, was made by Krin and published through Armor Games. It was first released on December 19, 2008.
							<br><br>
							The game has seven zones; five story zones and two bonus zones. The bonus zones can only be accessed on Challenging difficulty or higher, and Zone 7, Sho'Tul Shelf, can only be accessed if the Legend achievement has been completed.
							<br><br>
							Sonny 2 is set in the same universe as Sonny, a world with a vast array of technology and mental disciplines.
							<br><br>
							Characters use a variety of clubs, swords, rifles, staffs, magic, and more in combat, as well as utilizing a great number of specialized physical and mental attacks.
							<br><br>
							Much of the world seems to be overrun with zombies, which is probably the reason that the ZPCI (Zombie Pest Control Incorporated) was formed. The ZPCI are the main antagonists of the series; they will stop at nothing to remain in business, killing everyone involved in any research designed to find a cure for zombification.
							<br><br>
							Sonny frequently runs into ZPCI soldiers, as they attempt to kill him on sight (due to the fact that he is a zombie). The ZPCI have a potent presence in many places, particularly in large cities such as Hew.ere the player's team fights turn-based battles against the opposing team. On the player's turn, they may only control their own character (Sonny) directly by selecting abilities to use on a particular target of choice.

							Sonny 2 is primarily a single-player RPG, and is very similar to the first Sonny game. Gameplay is divided into three main interfaces:
							<br><br>
							1. The World Map, which shows all discovered locations (see Zones). From this screen the player can travel to zones that they have been to before.
							<br><br>
							2. The Roaming-Mode screen, in which the player can prepare for their next battle by organizing their inventory, their equipment, their skills (see Attributes and Abilities), saving the game, and visiting shops. This is the main screen, and players can engage in training battles, or primary battles to move further into the zone.
							<br><br>
							3. The Battle screen, where the player's team fights turn-based battles against the opposing team. On the player's turn, they may only control their own character (Sonny) directly by selecting abilities to use on a particular target of choice.

						<h2 class="subtitles">Multi-player</h2>
						<p class="descriptions">
							Sonny 2, unlike Sonny, includes the PVP feature. It is possible to export characters from separate or similar clients and then import them into the one game in order for them to battle each other, controlled by the players. There is no time limit for turns, regardless of whether either of the teams play in heroic mode normally.
							<br><br>
							However, it is evident that the game was not designed with PVP in mind, as the various character classes are highly imbalanced when it comes to PVP. It is possible for a Biological speed character, for example, to equip a certain combination of abilities that allows him to start an unpreventable one-shot-kill setup on any of the opposing team's members as soon as the match begins. Second to this character in terms of overpoweredness is the cold Hydraulic character, which can prevent the opposing team's "Sonny" from acting half the time, and from using focus the rest of the time, making most opposing characters next to useless.

						<h2 class="subtitles">Abilities</h2>
						<p class="descriptions">
							Sonny gains experience along with party members after every fight. Sonny levels up after gaining sufficient experience. Every level-up grants Sonny Ability Points and Attribute Points, which can be used to activate upgrades.
							<br><br>
							Ability Points are used to unlock or improve Abilities, which are based on Sonny's class (see Classes). Abilities are used for powerful attacks, healing, or to temporarily improve/reduce a character's Attributes. Unlike Sonny 1, in Sonny 2 the ability tree is different for each class (Psychological, Biological or Hydraulic).
							<br><br>
							Players have a wide range of different Abilities to unlock, that enable the creation of different "builds". For example, the Hydraulic class contains abilities for a "Hot Hydraulic" build, which focuses on attack, and a "Cold Hydraulic" build which focuses on defense.
							<br><br>
							Attribute Points are used to improve Sonny's 4 basic Attributes, consisting of Vitality, Strength, Instinct and Speed. The fifth Attribute, Focus, cannot be improved with Attribute Points. The importance of attributes various depending on Sonny's class.
							<br><br>
							Sonny also has a range of Piercing and Defense attributes, such as Lighting, Fire, Ice, and so on. Some special equipment contain bonuses for such attributes, that improves attacks of that type.
							<br><br>
							Sonny can wear/wield different kinds of equipment. Before a fight, players can modify the equipment configuration, or visit the Zone Shop to trade equipment. Also, certain enemies drop rare equipment that cannot be purchased at shops.
							<br><br>
							Before a fight, players can select a ring of 8 Abilities (the "Combat Action Bar") that can be used during a fight. Certain powerful abilities can be added twice to the ring, allowing for usage in successive turns. During a fight, the player can only control Sonny directly. The player can choose an enemy to attack, as well as an ability from the ring to attack/defend with. Certain abilities affect Sonny and party members (such as healing abilities) and certain can only be used on enemies (defensive and offensive abilities).
